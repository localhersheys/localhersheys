Hi, i'm kukki (more of a family name), better known as Harshita, and considering you're here, you might've stumbled on either,
1. one of my projects, or
2. maybe my socials.
either way, it's nice to see you around, while you're here, checkout some more of my projects ;)
quick run-down about me:
1. i'm a second year now and figuring out what to do with my life.
2. i'm an avid learner, not only do i love making mistakes and facing hardships,(just to eventually overcome them and feel like a genius :P), but i also love things that MAKE SENSE, and i MUST know how thigns work. having said that, i think it is quite obvious why i'm such a geek for maths and science as well as computer science. 
3. like an average indian, i love me a good jugaad :P
4. i hate working on things i could easily automate
