Hi, i'm Harshita, it's nice to see you around ;)
quick run-down about me:
1. i'm a second year now and figuring out what to do with my life.
2. i'm an avid learner, not only do i love making mistakes and facing hardships,(just to eventually overcome them and feel like a genius :P), but i also love things that MAKE SENSE, and i MUST know how things work. 
3. like an average indian, i love me a good jugaad :P
